This is an introductory level talk about Trio that @njsmith has been
iterating on. The goal is to take an audience that knows Python but
doesn't necessarily have any background in concurrency, and in ~45
minutes teach them the core ideas and convince them that Trio is
awesome. The motivating example is "happy eyeballs", and the finale is
live-coding it.

The slides here were created in `LibreOffice
<https://www.libreoffice.org/>`__ and use `Montserrat
<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat>`__, like the Trio logo,
because I am **on brand**. In theory .odp is a standard format, but in
practice you might need to install both of those to get them to render
properly. Sorry. Slide software is all terrible.

* 2018-03-14-sfpython.odp, 2018-03-14-sfpython-notebook.ipynb:
  Slides and notebook from the version I `gave at SF Python
  <https://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/246990804/>`__.
  This has some substantial additions from Pyninsula version below; in
  particular it's the first version to make the analogy between
  nurseries and structured programming.

  I'm told this was recorded and will be available at some point, but
  I don't know any more than that.

* 2018-01-31-pyninsula.odp, 2018-01-31-pyninsula-notebook.ipynb:
  Slides and notebook from the version I `gave at Pyninsula
  <https://www.meetup.com/Pyninsula-Python-Peninsula-Meetup/events/244939632/>`__;
  substantially revised/improved from the previous version.

  This talk was recorded and is `available on youtube

  Seminar.

* 2017-12-01-lbl-data-seminar-cheatsheet.ipynb: The notes I made ahead

  actual talk started with an empty notebook.)
