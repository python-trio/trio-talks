This is an introductory level talk about Trio that @njsmith has been
iterating on. The goal is to take an audience that knows Python but
doesn't necessarily have any background in concurrency, and in ~45
minutes teach them the core ideas and convince them that Trio is
awesome. The motivating example is "happy eyeballs", and the finale is
live-coding it.

The slides here were created in `LibreOffice
<https://www.libreoffice.org/>`__ and use `Montserrat
<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat>`__, like the Trio logo,
because I am **on brand**. You might need both of those to get them to
render properly. Sorry. Slide software is all terrible.
